# Web Tech Lab Task 1

This repository contains the solution for the first Web Technologies lab task. The goal is to practice core HTML tags by recreating the layout of a donation/registration form.

### Live View: https://r3gistrati0n.netlify.app/

## Project Structure

- `registration.html` – main submission replicating the multi-section donation form with donor, honorarium, and additional information panels.
- `LAB TASK 1.pdf` – original lab brief with the reference layout.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have a local web server set up (for example, XAMPP as used during the lab).
2. Place the project folder inside your server root (`htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Open the form in a browser:
   - `http://localhost/PATH/registration.html`

You can open the file directly in a browser as well, but hosting it locally provides a closer match to how course submissions are typically reviewed.

## Features Implemented

- Semantic HTML structure with separate sections for donor information, memorial details, and additional preferences.
- Input controls covering text fields, select elements, radio buttons, and checkboxes.
- Layout styling with CSS to mirror the reference screenshot, including inline option groups and responsive spacing.
- Required field indicators aligned with the brief.

## Customization Tips

- Update select options or placeholder text to match your institution or organization.
- Adjust styling in the `<style>` block within `registration.html` to fit alternate branding or color themes.
- Split the CSS into an external stylesheet if you plan to expand the project beyond the basic exercise.

## Validation and Testing

- Open `registration.html` in modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to confirm layout consistency.
- Use the browser developer tools or the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to verify HTML compliance.
- Toggle each control to ensure alignment and spacing remain intact when checked or filled.
